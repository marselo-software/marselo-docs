# Marselo

Marselo is a decentralized platform that integrates Cartesi Coprocessor and Ethereum’s Solidity to deliver advanced off-chain computation with on-chain guarantees. The platform leverages the Cartesi Coprocessor to run complex models and AI algorithms off-chain, ensuring that all critical data and results are securely validated and accessible on-chain.

By utilizing Cartesi's unique architecture, Marselo provides the scalability and flexibility needed for sophisticated AI agents, real-time insights, and data analysis, all within the blockchain ecosystem. The Ethereum network’s Solidity smart contracts handle the trading operations, while the Cartesi Coprocessor executes complex computations, creating a seamless interaction between on-chain and off-chain processes.

This hybrid approach ensures that Marselo can offer advanced AI-driven solutions without sacrificing security or decentralization, paving the way for a new era of decentralized applications with powerful, scalable AI capabilities.
